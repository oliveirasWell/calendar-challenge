# Calendar Component code challenge


#Running the Project
To start the Expo development server:

```
npm run start
```

This command starts the Metro Bundler, which is a JavaScript bundler for React Native. You can then open the project on your device using the Expo Go app, or in a simulator/emulator.

```
npm run ios
```

```
npm run android
```
